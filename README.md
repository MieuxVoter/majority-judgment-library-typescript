This typescript package helps to resolve polls using [Majority Judgment](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugement_majoritaire).

## Features

-   Efficient Majority Judgment algorithm, scales well to billions of participants
-   Configure whether to favor _adhesion_ or _contestation_ (default)
-   Balance proposal tallies using a static default grade or the median grade
-   Room for Central Judgment and Usual Judgment
-   Unit-tested (run `typescript test`)

## Get started

```typescript

import { MajorityJudgmentDeliberator, IDeliberator, ITally, Tally, ProposalTally, IResult } from "majority-judgment";

const deliberator:IDeliberator = new MajorityJudgmentDeliberator();
const tally:ITally = new Tally([
        // Amounts of judgments received for each grade, from "worst" grade to "best" grade
        new ProposalTally([4n, 5n, 2n, 1n, 3n, 1n, 2n]),  // Proposal A
        new ProposalTally([3n, 6n, 2n, 1n, 3n, 1n, 2n]),  // Proposal B
        // â€¦
}, 18);

const result:IResult = deliberator.deliberate(tally);

// Each proposal result has a rank, and results are returned by input order
console.assert(2 == result.proposalResults.length);
console.assert(2 == result.proposalResults[0].rank);  // Proposal A
console.assert(1 == result.proposalResults[1].rank);  // Proposal B
```
